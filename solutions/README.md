# 🌳 Tree DP Solutions from Codeforces

This folder contains solutions to various Tree Dynamic Programming problems from Codeforces.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Solutions are organized by problem type:
- **subtree-dp/** - Bottom-up DP on subtrees (classic tree DP)
- **rerooting/** - Rerooting technique (all roots DP)
- **tree-matching/** - Matching and independent set problems
- **distances/** - Distance-related problems
- **misc/** - Other tree DP problems

## 📝 Problem Categories

### Subtree DP (Bottom-Up)
Classic tree DP where we compute values for each node based on its children's values.

### Rerooting (All Roots DP)
Technique to compute answer for every node as root efficiently. Usually requires two passes:
1. Bottom-up to compute subtree information
2. Top-down to combine subtree info with parent information

### Tree Matching
Problems involving independent sets, vertex covers, and matchings on trees.

### Distance Problems
Problems computing distances, paths, or sums involving distances between nodes.
